### Archival disclaimer

> This repo was just an old fork that i did to work on `pug`/`vue` projects,
it's really not maintained, and i really don't know much about atom syntax highlighting
(if you see my changes, you can see what i did was pretty basic)

You probably should check out the [original repo](https://github.com/devongovett/atom-jade), there are plenty of contributors there,
it's more active and they got a clue what they are doing ðŸ˜…

<small>**If you want to be a maintainer, or if you want to pick up the [`apm` link (pug)](https://atom.io/packages/pug), just drop me an email.**</small>
